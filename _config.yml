description: [It’s not exhaustive, but a good representation of what I do. Please excuse any dead links, occasionally clients press the big red ‘reset’ button on their websites. Examples of product copy provided on request. I’ve included references to some of my print-only articles, but as I can’t link to them you’ll just have to take my word for their existence. Drop me a line at david.james.e (at) gmail.com if you have any questions.]
