## A Collecion of words, pictures, and projects written and/or produced by David Evans

It's not exhaustive, but a good representation of what I do. Please excuse any dead links, occasionally clients press the big red 'reset' button on their websites. Examples of product copy provided on request. I've included references to some of my print-only articles, but as I can't link to them you'll just have to take my word for their existence. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ShufferingShmiling/Portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ShufferingShmiling/Portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
