### A collecion of words, pictures, and projects written and/or produced by David Evans

It's not exhaustive, but a good representation of what I do. Please excuse any dead links, occasionally clients press the big red 'reset' button on their websites. Examples of product copy provided on request. I've included references to some of my print-only articles, but as I can't link to them you'll just have to take my word for their existence. Drop me a line at david.james.e (at) gmail.com if you have any questions.

### Rapha Rides USA video series

Strong candidate for the most fun I've had while being paid. Responsibilities included: creating the international Rapha Rides video brief; identifying the talent and concept for the six America shoots; leading prelimary interviews; art direction; leading the edit process between the director and brand-side creatives; a lot of driving. Los Angeles is linked below, and here's [New York](https://vimeo.com/221714081), [Seattle](https://vimeo.com/226391195), [Boulder](https://vimeo.com/215321383), [San Francisco](https://vimeo.com/215821947), and [Chicago](https://vimeo.com/229344370).

### RCC 2017 Shoot x2

Art Director of Rapha's 2017 RCC Shoots, one in upstate [New York](https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/stories/club-calling), spinning around the Catskills, the other in the [Lake District](https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/stories/lakes-of-grey). The models were sourced from the RCC (aka the Rapha Cycling Club), representing chapters from around the world.

### Theatres of Cross, Rapha

I accompanied photographer Ben Ingham to France and Belgium, where we visited some of cyclocross's most storied and celebrated courses. The resulting exhibiton was shown at Rapha Clubhouses around the world.
